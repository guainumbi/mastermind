A numbers - version of the game "mastermind". 

Mastermind is a code-breaking game for two players (in this case one player and the computer).
The computer generates a random 4-digit-number.
The codebreaker tries to guess the pattern, in both order and digit(analog-version: color). 
In the analog version - Each guess is made by placing a row of code pegs (digits) on the decoding board. 
Once placed, the codemaker provides feedback by placing from zero to four key pegs in the small holes of the row with the guess. 
A red key peg is placed for each code peg from the guess which is correct in both color(digit) and position. 
A white key peg indicates the existence of a correct color code peg(digit) placed in the wrong position.
